Sitemap Status Codes
====================

This script tests all urls in a sitemap and echos everything that does not return 200 OK


Based on this Gist:

Requirements
============
I think you need Python 3.x and BeautifulSoup 

Usage
=====
Please keep in mind that this is some kind of python sandbox for me. 
example:

```
python3 sitemap-status-codes.py -u https://www.vapesetups.com/sitemap -v
```
